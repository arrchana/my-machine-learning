Thanks a lot for the amazing review! Apart from just marking my answers as sufficient, you also gave "Pro Tips" which takes my learning experience to an entirely another higher level. When my answers were insufficient, you have given me more than enough material to ponder on, and get back on the right track. Illustrations with figure is very useful too, and "Suggestions and Comments" for some of the answers are very helpful.
